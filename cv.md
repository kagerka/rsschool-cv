SUMMARY
It was a long way to realize, that I love coding. And I wish it will be my job for many years. My main purpose is to learn a lot to have opportunity to work as a front-end developer. I don’t have many skills and experience now, but I have a lot of desire to make my wish come true. I passed this course in 2021, but my very big fault, that I didn't find job right after I finished JSFE-2021Q1. After year I understood, that I don't understand the code I wrote myself. It was too long break. So I'm here again and now I definitely will find a job as junior front-end developer.

SKILLS

CODE EXAMPLES

One of the tasks I solved on the codewars.com:

String.prototype.toAlternatingCase = function () {
let result = [];
for (let i = 0; i < this.length; i++) {
if (this[i] == this[i].toUpperCase()) {
result.push(this[i].toLowerCase());
} else {
result.push(this[i].toUpperCase());
}
}
return result.join('');
}
